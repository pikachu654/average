This is a test to use dockers in githubs action sequence. This program takes 3 different numbers from the terminal and outputs the average of them in the terminal (testing to get it into a txt file)

to use docker change the inputs of the file run_hello2.sh from '1' '2' '3', to your desired numbers, then build the docker file using the command:
    ```
    docker build - < Dockerfile
    ```

Then run 
    ```
    docker run
    ```.
